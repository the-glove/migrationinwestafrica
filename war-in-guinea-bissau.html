                    Refugees and the War for Independence in Guinea-Bissau
                    </h2>
                    <p>
    Following the massacre of more than 50 striking dockworkers at the
Pidjiguiti docks in Bissau, the capital of colonial Portuguese Guinea, the    <i>Partido Africano para a Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde </i>(PAIGC)
    established a base in Conakry, the capital of independent Guinea, with the
    aim of fighting for national liberation. The PAIGC relied on ties across
    both of Portuguese Guinea’s borders (Senegal and Guinea) to carry out
    military operations against the Portuguese.
</p>
<p>
    Equally important to the cross-border movement of independence fighters was
    the substantial number of refugees who fled out of Portuguese Guinea facing
    violence and economic devastation. Census figures between 1960 and 1970
    indicate a decline of 12.4 percent of the colony’s population, but other
    estimates suggest over 20 percent of the population left by the end of the
    war. Many of these settled in border communities in southern Senegal and
    Guinea, although some moved farther into Gambia.
</p>
<p>
    Portuguese Guineans fleeing to Senegal did so for a variety of reasons.
    Some cited the requisitioning of cattle and harassment by the PAIGC forces
    fighting for independence, while others fled precipitously during attacks
    by one side or the other. One woman I interviewed in 2017 described the
    situation as producing never-ending fear, with women hiding in forests to
    avoid open areas that were more likely to be bombed. And the PAIGC’s
    demands for food and cattle for their war effort placed already-stretched
    farmers in an even more precarious position.
</p>
<p>
    Arguably, however, life became even more difficult as time went by in areas
    that were still under Portuguese control. The PAIGC struck at Portuguese
    trading operations in the eastern part of the colony, making the growing
    and selling of peanuts difficult, and disrupting Portuguese distribution
    routes, while continuing to control the primary rice-growing areas and
    allowing little access to them.
</p>
<p>
    By the close of the war, more than 100,000 Bissau-Guineans lived outside of
    their newly-independent state, and it was unclear how many would return to
    the country. Numerous refugees who had fled to Senegal and Guinea returned
    after hostilities ceased, but their migrations in this period were not the
    only noteworthy ones. Many had fled dangerously exposed villages for towns,
    and returned quickly to their former homes. However, those homes often
    needed to be rebuilt.
</p>
<p>
    Many in the liberated areas controlled by the PAIGC had established new
    villages in the forest to escape Portuguese bombing, but after the war
    returned to re-establish villages in or near their former locations in open
    country. All this planning and construction activity generally occurred at
    the expense of agriculture and meant that roughly 90 percent of the food in
    Guinea-Bissau in the year after independence had to be imported.
</p>
<p>
    Most estimates of the Bissau-Guinean population in Senegal indicate that
    about half of the refugee population returned in the years after the war.
    Similar percentages of Fulbe refugees returned to their former villages
    from southern Senegal to rebuild their lives. But by the same token,
    roughly half stayed in Senegal, where they had joined family during the war
    and/or established new connections.
</p>
<p>
    After the close of the war, there was a great deal of tension between
    former PAIGC and former Portuguese soldiers. PAIGC soldiers killed former
    Portuguese soldiers, political opponents, and coup plotters throughout the
    late 1970s. Oral histories I conducted in 2017 support the idea that the
    PAIGC government targeted ex-Portuguese troops, even sending its own
    soldiers into Senegal to search for them there. Several from Guinea-Bissau
    reported of the PAIGC searching for “traitors” in Senegal, and
    Bissau-Guinean news reports in the weeks following Nino Vieira’s 1980 coup
    alleged massacres of former Portuguese soldiers—the ending of which was one
    of the coup’s stated objectives.
</p>
<p>
    Even as about 50,000 returned home, some soldiers fled to Senegal to avoid
    persecution. One former Portuguese soldier crossed the border to the
    village of Medina Ndoondi, where he already had family. Typically, the
    PAIGC searched for ex-soldiers who had played more prominent roles during
    the war. Two soldiers I spoke with both stated that while the PAIGC
    targeted ex-Portuguese soldiers, no one in a position to do anything about
    it knew about their participation in the war. Many of these former
    Portuguese soldiers returned to Guinea-Bissau in the years following
    independence, when they believed the political climate was less fraught.
</p>
<p>
    For both those who fled during the war and those who fled after, their ties
    in Guinea-Bissau remained strong. This allowed them to profit economically
    from cross-border networks and create opportunities for themselves and
    their extended family on both sides of the border. Very few people severed
    their ties with Guinea-Bissau entirely, and some still consider themselves
    Bissau-Guinean despite living in Senegal for half a century.
