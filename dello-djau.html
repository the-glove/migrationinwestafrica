			<p>
Dello Djau was born in the village of Sambale Corubali near    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sfonwVP7itktrQFA7">Galomaro</a> Cossé in
    eastern Guinea-Bissau. When the war for independence began, he was
    seventeen years old. Despite the ongoing war, he regularly went to Senegal
    to harvest peanuts seasonally for eleven rainy seasons. He went to seven
    different villages in the Saloum area of central Senegal, using the money
    he earned to buy products unavailable at home.
</p>
<p>
    He needed to leave for work because taxes were so high during the war that
    people were unable to pay it without leaving to search for money. People
    also had to work on forced labor projects to build roads in the colony.
</p>
<p>
    During the war, Dello was able to avoid fighting on either side, however,
    he said many from his village fought with the
    <a

    >
        PAIGC
    </a>
    . He moved to several other villages before settling in the regional
    capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafat%C3%A1">Bafatá</a>
    nearly 40 years ago.

    <h3><em>Interview</em>
	</h3>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    People used to cross the border and work in Kan Ñambali, in Kontiba, in
    Baaru, all the way until Farifu. They would farm peanuts and when they were
    done you would harvest and everything. I went there to look for money and
    when I had it, when I returned, I would buy shirts and pants and shoes. I
    would bring the money I had saved back.
</p>
<p>
    <em>During that period, did you go to Senegal to harvest peanuts?</em>
</p>
<p>
    In Senegal, I went for eleven years. For three years I had an elder there
    but for the last eight years I was the elder harvesting there.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Where did you go in Senegal?</em>
</p>
<p>
    In Senegal I worked in Loumbel Kelli the first time. Then in Mboulol for
the second through fifth times. I went to Fass between<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossas">Gossas</a> and    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaolack">Kaolack</a> for the sixth
    and seventh times. And to Ndawel for the eight time. To
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mback%C3%A9_Department">
        Touba Mbacke
    </a>
    in the village named Missira Mame Balla for the ninth time. and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mback%C3%A9_Department">
        Mbacke Baol
    </a>
was the tenth time. Then I went to Ngueloum near    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinguin%C3%A9o">Guinguineo</a> for
    the eleventh time.
</p>
<p>
    <em>How did you find villages to harvest peanuts in?</em>
</p>
<p>
    From Mboss to Mboulel to Thadiaye to Ndawel; I know Senegal more than many
those born there. All the villages I mentioned are in the    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine-Saloum">Saloum area</a>; Niiri
    Samba Ndaw , Keur Samba Ndour, Mbar Diawe, Mbacke Baol, Touba, Missiri Mame
    Balla are villages I know well. All in Saloum.
</p>
<p>
    <em>How did you get food there?</em>
</p>
<p>
    We went to a hut where there was a restaurant. We were there for four or
    five months. We slept there, we washed there. Sometimes the youngest would
    go begging for food and bring it for us all to eat.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Did you pay for that?</em>
</p>
<p>
    We did not have to pay for that. But we would work for our host a few days
    a week. We would harvest and thresh peanuts, or we would find fire wood for
    his wives or pull water. And when we had food, they would cook it for us
    and we would all share.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        When you came back to Guinea-Bissau, did you bring things with you?
        What did you buy in Senegal?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    At that time, 5,000 CFA [in Senegal] was the same as 2,500 in
    Guinea-Bissau. We would buy pants and shirts and shoes. We would also buy
    bicycles to use here.
</p>
<p>
    How much money did you make each year?
</p>
<p>
    In Ndewel, I made 7,000. In Mboulel, 4,700. I came back with 5,700 another
    time. Another time 4,700. In Missira Mame Ball I never made more than
    5,000. In Touba, I made 5,350.
</p>
<p>
    <em>At that time, how much was a bicycle?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Some were 3,000, some were 1,500, and some were 2,500.
