                    Guinea after Independence: Searching for Opportunity
                    </h2>
                   <p>
    Following independence from the French in 1958, the declining political and
    economic situation led many migrants to flee Guinea for neighboring
    countries, including Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra
    Leone, and Liberia. Some migrants fled Guinea and established themselves in
    villages where family members had previously moved for economic opportunity
    or to escape harsh colonial policies like military conscription, forced
    labor, and taxation. In the first ten years following Guinean independence,
    Fulbe people from Futa Jallon (Fulbe Futa) flooded into southern Senegal.
    An estimated 14,000 lived in the region of Kolda at independence, but that
    number grew to around 56,000 by 1968. In addition to those who settled in
    Kolda, significant numbers went elsewhere in Senegal, many to the capital
    of Dakar and to eastern parts of Gambia. Both before and after the war in
    Portuguese Guinea/Guinea-Bissau, Guinean Fulbe settled there as well.
</p>
<p>
After Guinean independence, Sékou Touré’s    <em>Parti Démocratique de Guinée </em>(PDG) government enacted a form of
    socialism centered along proud nationalism and a strong central government
    that would reshape the economy. After economic turmoil in the early 1960s,
    the Guinean government put in place a substantial set of reforms known as
    the Loi-Cadre of 1964. A strong distillation of the economic philosophy of
    the Touré/PDG government, these reforms included a further crackdown on
    private trade, achieved by reducing the number of licensed merchants; and
    soon afterwards, the importation and exportation of a range of specific
    products was taken over entirely by state enterprises. These policies
    increased the incentive for migration, but the Loi-Cadre also doubled the
    number of border guards, making it more challenging to migrate.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, while border crossing became more difficult at the individual
    level, the new policy had little effect on the overall number of people
    emigrating from Guinea. Once migrants had crossed the border, they could
    blend into communities where they already spoke the language, and often
    followed their own family members to communities where they could more
    easily integrate. However, the passage across the border was dangerous,
    with Guinean military patrols seeking to catch migrants and punish them for
    their insolence. Some migrants attempting to leave Guinea were even shot
    and killed.
</p>
<p>
    The economic policies enacted by Touré and the PDG were met in Futa Jallon
    with skepticism, often amounting to hostility. The creation in 1960 of a
    weak Guinean replacement for the French franc, the sily, along with the
    removal of trade from private hands, left fewer opportunities for Fulbe
    traders and others to make profits. With most restricted from operating in
    the private market, their main options were to smuggle goods in and out of
    Guinea, or to move their businesses out of the country entirely. Sellers of
    kola nuts, fabric, and jewelry left, along with individuals who would
    become dealers in charcoal and fruit in Senegal and the Gambia.
</p>
<p>
    By 1974, an estimated 300,000 Guineans (almost 7 percent of the country’s
    population) were in Senegal alone, the vast majority of whom were in rural
    villages and towns throughout the country. Most of these were from Fulbe
    areas of the Futa Jallon plateau. Farmers were hit particularly hard by the
    Guinean government’s policies, which set prices for agricultural products
    well below their market values and enforced such prices vigorously, even at
    small weekly markets. But those who tried to take their agricultural
    products or herds out of the country risked imprisonment.
</p>
<p>
    The departure of large numbers of farmers resulted in a substantial decline
    in food production, increasing economic vulnerability and adding more fuel
    to Touré’s argument that the Fulbe were traitors to the nation. Many also
    took their herds across the border rather than keep them in state-mandated
    communal pens, and this led to a substantial decrease in cattle ownership,
    from one cow per two people in 1965 to one cow per three people in 1974.
    The quantity of cattle in the region saw even greater reductions, since the
    per capita decline coincided with a simultaneous decline in the region’s
    human population. Pastoralists were also required to sell a certain
    percentage of their herds to the state each year at very low prices, which
    increased the incentive for migration.
</p>
<p>
    Given the long tradition of historical migration out of Futa Jallon to
    other parts of the region, migrants had ample opportunity and experience
    with border crossing. This allowed them to move when circumstances were
    difficult, or just when economic opportunities were more prevalent on other
    sides of the border.
