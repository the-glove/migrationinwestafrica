                    Seasonal Farming
                    </h2>
                    <p>
    During the colonial period and after, Fulbe and others crossed borders
    annually to work on peanut farms. Colonial economies relied substantially
    on exports, and in West Africa, much of that took the form of peanut
    production. Peanut production became commercialized in the 1830s along the
    Gambia River, before reaching Senegal and then-Portuguese Guinea in the
    1840s. During the early twentieth century, this production pushed further
    inland, and by the mid-twentieth century peanut production came to dominate
    colonial agricultural production in southern Senegambia. Most of this
    overseas consumption revolved around using peanuts to produce peanut-based
    soaps and oils, which could, among its many other uses, be used for cooking
    and to produce candles.
</p>
<p>
    However, in many areas the number of able-bodied farmers was insufficient
    to produce peanuts in large quantities for export. As a result, migrants
    from elsewhere in the broader region would migrate to central Senegal and
    Gambia to work on others’ land. Seasonal farmers came from Guinea-Bissau,
    and Mali (then-French Sudan) into Gambia and the peanut basin of central
    Senegal (to the north of Gambia). These farmers would be hosted by
    families, who fed them and housed them in exchange for their labor and a
    certain percentage of what they produced. Depending on the arrangement,
    seasonal peanut farmers worked between two and four days a week for their
    hosts, and the rest of the time for themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Many Fulbe and others saw seasonal farming as a way to make hard cash and
    buy goods not available at home, then return to their communities in a much
    stronger economic position than before. These movements were particularly
    intense out of Mali in the early twentieth century, before shifting in the
    1940s toward Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. The harsh burdens of colonial
    taxation meant people needed to have money to pay the colonial government,
    and so seasonal farming created opportunities to make money without having
    to sell animals, their own personal food crops, or whatever else they
    needed. In Senegal, these farmers were known as <em>navétanes, </em>from
    the Wolof <em>nawet</em> (rainy season). In Gambia, they were referred to
    as “strange farmers,” in a reference to the foreign origin that made them
    “strangers” in the country.
</p>
<p>
    These migrations were particularly prominent among young men, who saw
    opportunities to break free from their parents and ordinary village life,
    and travel to see other regions or colonies. Many used their income to
    collect money to build their own homes, pay bride-prices, buy bicycles, or
    purchase clothing or fabric for their growing families. Seasonal farming
    was not easy. It was a challenge to find a host. If you someone agreed to
    take you in as their “strange farmer,” they would feed you and house you,
    but otherwise you would need to beg for your food, and sleep outside on the
    ground.
</p>
<p>
    Seasonal farming caused challenges in both sending and receiving
    communities. For most of the year, women took over in many families as
    temporary heads of household as their husbands headed elsewhere. In
    addition to their normal responsibilities, they became increasingly
    responsible for agricultural production for the entire family, which they
    had previously shared with men.<sup> </sup>In receiving communities, women
    took over the responsibilities of cooking, cleaning, and washing clothes
    for seasonal farmers, gathering whatever leaves they could find to make
    sauce for meals. Most would return home at the end of the farming season,
    but some would stay, marry local women, and establish roots.
</p>
<p>
    Some of these farmers would return year after year, at times continuing
    these patterns for over a decade. In rural parts of Guinea-Bissau and
    Guinea, where it was difficult to profit economically, the migration of
    young men to Senegal and Gambia came to be seen as a rite of passage.
    Seasonal work is still quite common throughout Senegambia, although without
    the large numbers of seasonal migrants seen during most of the twentieth
    century.
</p>
<p>
    When conducting research in Guinea-Bissau in 2017, I noticed a reversal of
    historical patterns: young men from Senegal were heading south to
    Guinea-Bissau to take part in seasonal cashew harvesting. Cashews, a
    lucrative crop that today makes up a substantial portion of Guinea-Bissau’s
    exports, has attracted migrants much in the way peanuts did roughly a
    century ago.
