                    Hawa Balde
                    </h2>
                    
			<p>
    Hawa Balde was originally from the village of Sare Yela in the district of
    Paunca, in the region of Gabu in eastern Portuguese Guinea. She and her
    family were allied with the Portuguese during the war for independence.
    During the war, the independence fighters attacked her village because of
    their allegiance with the Portuguese. Because they were scared, they stayed
    in the forest for three years, only returning to the village to cook and
    eat dinner. They lived in fear of being attacked and having the village
    burned down. The war was particularly on the women of the community,
    because they were left at home, responsible for their childrens’ safety
    while their husbands were off fighting.
</p>
<p>
    As a result of the violence of the war, Hawa went to Senegal with her
    daughters and husband. At first they went to Sare Demba Bouya before
    heading to the city of Kolda. After moving several times, they finally
    settled in the town of Mampatim.
</p>
<p>
    After the war, the PAIGC targeted former Portuguese soldiers, including
    Hawa’s husband. Soldiers came to the village where they were living
    searching for her husband. She lied to them, and then they left for
    northern Senegal until things calmed down.
</p>
<p>
    Generally though, things were peaceful between Senegal and Guinea-Bissau.
    She began to return regularly to Guinea-Bissau after the end of the war,
    and it was not difficult to cross the border. She was able to get papers as
    a Senegalese citizen because of her family in Sare Demba Bouya.

    <h3><em>Interview</em>
			</h3>
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    We are from Guinea-Bissau. We were with the Portuguese. At that time, a
    group of black people entered the forest as rebels of the PAIGC. At first,
    they said it was non-violent but they would come and attack the village and
    we would have to run away. For three years we slept in the woods. We just
    come back once a day to the village for dinner and return with all our kids
    after they had breastfed until they would stop crying [so they wouldn’t be
    heard by the PAIGC]. If they [the PAIGC] came, they would loot our homes;
    food, clothing, all of our things. Only you would run. Sometimes you would
    leave only with one skirt [the one you were wearing] and we would not have
    time to take our valuables with us; some would even leave their kids behind
    and run to escape. That was our life for the eleven years of the war: only
    hiding. White people [Portuguese] would see us and try to help us, but the
    PAIGC hiding in the forest would place mines everywhere to kill people.
    People would run away, or if they had a bicycle they would ride that. If
    they [the PAIGC] found food in your hut you would not eat [because they
    would take it], if they found clothes or kola nuts they would take that and
    anything else you had. That is my story.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Did you any of your relatives fight with the Portuguese and run from
        Guinea-Bissau to Senegal because of the PAIGC [government after
        independence]?<strong></strong>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Those who were with the Portuguese, after the war ended some of them moved
    to Senegal and some of them were killed! My husband was a Portuguese
    soldier.
</p>
<p>
    <em>How did the PAIGC know who was working with the Portuguese?</em>
</p>
<p>
    We were all living in the same country. They were Portuguese people who
    protected and knew us and the PAIGC did not protect us and knew who the
    Portuguese had protected. So we came to Kolda [in Senegal] but they came and
    sent us back; many of our husbands were killed there, those who were lucky
    stayed here [and were not sent back to Guinea-Bissau].
</p>
<p>
    <em>Was the time of the war more difficult for men or for women?</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    It was more difficult for women because we had to take care of our
    children! If they [the PAIGC] came, your husband would run and leave us
    with our children and our things. You had to run with all your kids and
    whatever you could carry. If we were in a normal village, we could have
    time to take our stuff and move across the border, but we were living in
    hideouts and they always surprised us and shot at us!
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Did you come here with your husband? Did you come straight to Mampatim?
        Where did you go? Is it near here?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Yes, we came together but not straight to Mampatim. We went first to Sare
    Dembadina, also known as Jimba Sara, near Sare Alet, and went to Kolda
    after that. In Sare Demba[dina] we stayed with one of my full siblings but
    in Kolda we lived in people’s homes until the PAIGC started to come to
    bring people back home to execute them.
</p>
<p>
    <em>How did they [the PAIGC] do that in Senegal?</em>
</p>
<p>
    They came here and took people. If you anyone in Kolda they can tell you
    until you understand! They came and ask the Senegalese government to give
    them their people because they want to bring them back because the country
    is peaceful now.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Did they try to bring you back?</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    They did. There was once time when they came to Santakoye from Saare Wassa.
    They woke me up and ask me where my husband was; at this time my husband
    had gone to another village and I told them I did not know. I also told
    them that my husband was the son of the chief of the village. They left. I
    refused to collaborate; they climbed in a big tree and looked around and I
    went and call the chief of the village who came and confirmed that I was
    his daughter-in-law and told us to go into his room; me and my children and
    to wait for my husband to come. When my husband came that night the chief
    explained him and we left here and went to Mbour [hundreds of miles away in
    central Senegal], after spending some time in Fatick and Thiadiaye.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Was it difficult to go to so many villages?</em>
</p>
<p>
    It was very difficult.
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>How did you make connections or friends in a new village?</em>
</p>
<p>
    You came and explained to the chief of the village, who welcomed you and
    who found a place for you to stay until you fill unsafe there and you moved
    to another village.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Did you move with your husband and all of your children?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Yes all of us! We could not stay in the same place for long because of
    security reasons. We went to Orsu, Madina Gounass on the road to Dakar
    where we stayed for a while, and Dar Salam as well. [These are all villages
    in southern Senegal.]
</p>
<p>
    <em>When did you come here? How long ago?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Almost fifty years now [in Senegal] because all my sons were born here.
    Only my daughters were born in Guinea-Bissau.
