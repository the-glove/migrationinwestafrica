                   El Hadji Balde
                    </h2>
                    
			<p>
    El Hadji Balde was from a very prominent family in the town of Candjufa in
    Portuguese Guinea. Before the war, he worked in the capital of Bissau for
    the <em>Casa Gouveia</em>, one of the largest commercial houses in the
    colony. During that time, he actually worked with Amilcar Cabral, who would
    go on to lead the independence movement. Despite this, during the war he
    fought alongside the Portuguese because he liked them better (this is
    likely because his family was closely tied to the colonial government).
</p>
<p>
    He supported Bissau-Guinean independence but thought Cabral and the PAIGC
    wanted too strong a break with Portugal. In the opinion of him and his
    friends, an independent Guinea-Bissau should have a strong relationship
    with Portugal, just like Senegal had with the French. They also wanted an
    independence without war.
</p>
<p>
    El Hadji had extensive cross-border ties. Before the war, he went to
    Senegal to trade, and following independence, traded in Gambia for many
    years. Immediately following the war, he left to the town of Guiro Yero
    Bocar in southern Senegal, because the PAIGC was searching for
    ex-Portuguese soldiers. There, he stayed with his brother, who had
    previously migrated to Senegal. After a few years, he returned to
    Guinea-Bissau, where he lives today in the town of Candjufa.

   <h3> <em>Interview</em>
	</h3>
	   </p>
<p>
    <em>
        If you received independence like Senegal, would you have accepted
        that?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    That is what we wanted the most. Portuguese and blacks working together,
    Portuguese supporting blacks, but them [the PAIGC], they preferred total
    independence.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Did Guinea-Bissau have total or moral independence?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Total.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Did the war tire people?</em>
</p>
<p>
    A lot.
</p>
<p>
    <em>How? Can you give me an example?</em>
</p>
<p>
    PAIGC came and burnt this village, but that was not what Cabral had
    ordered. Burning down villages was not his agenda. He wanted to talk to
    people extensively until they understood his intelligence, until they
    accept his fight, not burning villages.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Why did they burn houses, they didn’t have anything to eat, they didn’t
        have anything?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    They didn’t have food, so they took cows and sheep and millet from people
    for their food.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        After the war did PAIGC accept people who had been Portuguese troops?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    At the beginning, they did not accept us. I was a Commandant and we went to
    Senegal after the war.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Where?</em>
</p>
<p>
    I went to Guiro Yero Bokar. The current village chief is my brother. The
    same mother and the same father. I ran there and stayed there three years
    and seven months. The war was completely done and I came back.
</p>
<p>
    <em>When you went there the war had not ended yet?</em>
</p>
<p>
    No, the war was over. When the war ended, they locked up some former
    Portuguese troops and they were killing others. The PAIGC did that. That is
    why we ran.
</p>
<p>
    <em>How long did you stay there? Until it was calm?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Until it was calm, and then we came back.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Since you returned you haven’t had any problem? Until today?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Yes, now I am the head of the district; I have eighty-seven villages. I am
    the ruler.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        The PAIGC won, and you came back and reintegrated. How did you
        reintegrate?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    It is because I am a native. I was born here in this land. They cannot tell
    me that I can’t be someone here. They cannot do that.
