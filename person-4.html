                    Pathé Mballo
                    </h2>
                    <p>
    Pathé Mballo was born in Portuguese Guinea near the Senegal border. When he
    was 15 years old, the war for independence began. He briefly fled to
    Senegal but returned to the war and moved around between a variety of
    communities. Eventually, he moved to the capital city of Bissau and became
    a Portuguese soldier, for whom he fought for three years. Many of the
    independence fighters were based in Senegal, and Portuguese troops were not
    allowed to cross into Senegal to fight them.
</p>
<p>
    Pathé joined the Portuguese military because it was one of the few ways to
    earn money he could use for his family. During the war, he learned
    Portuguese Creole (the <em>lingua franca </em>of Guinea-Bissau) to speak
    with his fellow Bissau-Guinean soldiers and Portuguese to speak with the
    Portuguese soldiers. With a month and a half left in the war (early 1974),
    he fled to Senegal where has lived ever since, living in the border town of
    Pakour.
</p>
<p>
    Though he wanted to return to Guinea-Bissau later in his life, he could not
    because his family refused. They considered themselves Senegalese, and
    since most of his extended family had fled to Senegal during the war, they
    saw little reason to return. Unmarried people who came to Senegal married
    women from Senegal, thus giving them deeper roots in their new country.

    <h3><em>Interview</em>
		</h3>
	    
</p>		<p>
    It was white people who came here. They had trouble with black people and
    the PAIGC because they [Portuguese] wanted white people to lead the
    country. You know white people are clever; they had been doing politics
    until they knew everything. That’s why black people [the PAIGC] did not
    shoot them when they saw them [the Portuguese] escorting black people; they
    waited until black people were on their way back and they shot at them.
    After that, the white people will call Bissau telling them that people were
    attacked. So white people were very organized. One day an important
    Portuguese man we worked with, he put some tobacco in his pipe and smoked
    it and asked us if we knew what it was. We said no and he replied saying
    “You blacks! You are grown adults, and you see something new, and you don’t
    ask about it?” The Portuguese were so organized that when someone was
    killed, he still got paid. But we were paid until you died and that was it!
    We were paid 20 escudos per day and 700 per month, what did we have? They
    did not pay for our food either. We did it for long time until the end of
    the war. They got money from the bank in Bissau and some of us were given
    30, 20 or 10. We were the donkeys who were doing all the work and if you
    died, you lost everything. You were killed, you lost everything. The
    Portuguese troops were paid 900; that was the normal rate, whether you were
    educated or uneducated. While we were the militia who were in charge of
    carrying their staff for them and it was tiring work. We did that until the
    war ended and people started running and coming here [Senegal]. The total
    length of the war is fifty-four years because we lived it for seven years
    and for forty-seven years we have been here [in Senegal], which will be a
    total number of fifty-four years. Since then, we have been living here in
    peace.
</p>
<p>
    I got married while I was at Kopa; but we only lived together for one rainy
    season because I was a soldier and since they were civilians they ran and
    came here to survive from the war. If you are not paid well, you are
    risking your life every day, and your wife runs away [to Senegal] what are
    you doing here? That is how I came here to Casamance [southern Senegal] to
    join my wife. We moved here to Kopa for a month and half and the Portuguese
    returned back home [to Portugal]. A month and half later, they said that
    the war was ended in Guinea-Bissau; Then they [the PAIGC] took the country
    and named it Guinea-Bissau and and the name Portuguese Guinea died. I did
    not study this in school, but I still have the story in my mind.
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        When the war was over, you did not want to go back in Guinea-Bissau?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    When the war ended, I wanted to return but those in my household would not
    accept me going back, because all of them were born here and all of them
    only know Senegalese knowledge. Now if I was in Guinea-Bissau how would I
    have anything? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Do you still have relatives there? </em>
</p>
<p>
    In Guinea-Bissau, we have there many Fulbe people, but our relatives are
    all here; our “relatives” there are because we all got married the same
    year during our fathers’ time. So they are not exactly relatives, but we
    all Pulaar-speakers and all “related.”
