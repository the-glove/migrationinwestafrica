                    <h2>
                    Moussa Traoré
                    </h2>
                    
			<p>
    Moussa Traoré was born in Portuguese Guinea (Guinea-Bissau). His father was
    originally from Mali (then the colony of French Sudan), but fled first for
    Senegal and then Portuguese Guinea after the French tried to conscript him
    into the colonial military. During the war for independence, his family
    supported the Portuguese against the independence fighters. His brother was
    forced to fight in the Portuguese colonial military, which made his family
    lose support for the Portuguese.
</p>
<p>
    While he was living in the village of Sare Baaka in Portuguese Guinea, the
    PAIGC independence forces came and attacked the village for collaborating
    with the Portuguese. Eventually, the instability made them flee Portuguese
    Guinea entirely. At first, his family settled in a border village (Kidely),
    but were worried that it was too close to the war, so they moved to
    Mampatim, about 15 miles from the border. His sister had married an
    official in Mampatim, so when they decided to move, they knew they would
    have family there.
</p>
<p>
    According to Moussa, you had to be very careful crossing the border during
    the war. If the Portuguese saw you leaving the colony, they would assume
    you were with the PAIGC and would arrest or even kill you.
</p>
<p>
    After the war, Moussa was able to get a certificate asserting his
    Senegalese citizenship. He told the Senegalese government he was originally
    from the border village of Medina Ndoondi (which had no health facilities
    to register births), and so claimed that as his place of birth to get legal
    documents. Because most people did not have documentation during the
    colonial period, the government did not aggressively question those looking
    for documentation.

<h3>
    <strong>Interview</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    I am Bambara [an ethnic group that makes up the majority of Malians]; my
father was from Mali and went to Guinea-Bissau. At the time of the    <em>tirailleurs </em>[West African French colonial soldiers], they wanted
    him to become a <em>tirailleur</em> [soldier] for the French colony, but my
    father did not not want so he left there and went to Guinea-Bissau. He was
    in Guinea-Bissau for a little, and then he left there and went to Medina
    Ndoondi near Coumbacara [in Senegal]; he was there for a little and then we
    left there and were in Sare Mamadi near Sare Baaka [in Guinea-Bissau]. We
    were there: me, my mother, my elder brother and our possessions and
    animals. We were with the Portuguese. We were with them. We were then until
    they took my older brother into the Portuguese army; there were four
    children of us left. The Portuguese gave us guns.
</p>
<p>
    I was there until the PAIGC [independence forces] came at night and
    attacked Sare Baaka. Sare Baaka and Sare Mamadi [his village] were the same
    place. They attacked Sare Baaka because they knew Portuguese were in Sare
    Baaka and that the village was with the Portuguese, and the PAIGC and the
    Portuguese were fighting. They came into our village and hey shot at us and
    killed one person, the village chief’s son. When the PAIGC came, we ran
    away, and my elder brother went to untie the cows. One PAIGC soldier shot
    at him and thought he had hit him, but he did not. We took the cows and we
    came to Senegal near the border at Lingewa. We were there, we ran to come
    to the border. We slept by the border until morning and said we had been
    shot at. After that, the Portuguese came and asked us what had happened and
    we explaned that we were attacked and did not dare to shoot them back; they
    asked for the guns, but we had hid the guns. They asked the eldest of the
    group who said he shot but when they asked for proof he ran away and came
    to Senegal.
</p>
<p>
    Then that morning the Portuguese came to ask us, troops came to attack Sare
    Baaka and came to shoot at us. Now we ran. Then the Portuguese told us we
    could not to go to Senegal, that we should go back to our village in Sare
    Mamadi. We went back but did not trust them, so we ran and came to Kideli
    [in Senegal] where the commissioner who was married to one of our
    [family’s] daughters was living. But my father said that it was too risky
    to stay there because it was close [to Guinea-Bissau], that we should come
    here in Mampatim. We left there; we came here. That is how I came here.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Did you have relatives here? What kind of relationship existed between
        you and the commissioner?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    He married our daughter and was nicknamed the commissioner, but he was
    Senegalese. Now we have been living here for almost fifty years; since
    1974/ 1975.
